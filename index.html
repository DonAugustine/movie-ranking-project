<h1>The Best Movies According To Justin</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Field of Dreams</h3>
<p>
    This is one of the best baseball movies I've ever seen.<br />
    Kevin Costner is one of the best actors of my generation.<br />
    I used to be a baseball player, so it gives me a sense of nostalgia<br />
    when I watch it.

<h3>Happy Gilmore</h3>
<p>
    This movie is a comedy about golf. Sometimes I feel like Adam Sandler<br />
    plays the same character in all of his movies, but he was truly hilarious<br />
    in this.   
</p>
<h3>Donnie Darko</h3>
<p>
    This is a strange movie. Personally, I'm a fan of Jake Gyllenhaal's work.<br />
    I was riveted when I first watched this because I wasn't sure exactly what<br />
    was going on. Was it something supernatural that was happening? Was the main<br />
    character crazy? For that reason, it really drew me in.
